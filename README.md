Villains-Game
=============

Try to kill as many villains as possible by pushing them off the screen.

You can move by pressing "n" (Up), "e" (Right), "s" (down), and "w" (left). Pressing "p" will push all the villains immediately above, below, to the left, and to the right of you one spot in the corresponding direction. Ideally, the goal is to push all of the villains off the board. Pressing "Enter" will have the computer pick the move for you in what it deems as the best move in that situation (generally to stay "still"). Good luck!
